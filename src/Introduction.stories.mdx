Check the [code on github](https://github.com/ivorhoulker/rphk-ui).

The ui components are used by the nextjs frontend in the Presence monorepo.

Note that there is a **dark mode button** (the little crescent moon) in the top bar. Toggle it to see dark and light mode versions.

## About Storybook

[Check the docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).

Storybook is a tool for UI development, that lets you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
UI states are saved as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse stories by navigating to them in the sidebar.

Switch from "Canvas" to "Docs" at the top, to see further information and code snippets of how components are implemented.
